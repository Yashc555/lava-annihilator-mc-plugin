**The problem my plugin is trying to solve:**
In servers where PVP is off ppl use lava as their weapon and burn people to DEATH!

**How it works:**
With my plugin players can type /lavadamage off to turn off damage from lava which is placed by players in a radius of 4*4.
But if he falls into a lava pool then he will take damage.

**Commands:**
Lava does not do damage - /lavadamage off
Lava does damage - /lavadamage on
Help - /lavadamage help

**For example:**
Bob has turned damage by lava off.
Now, if John tries to place lava in a radius of 4 blocks of Bob, he won't be able to place lava.

**Support:**
You can message me your problem on:

**Customize:**
If you want this plugin customized, you can reach out to me on my discord or e-mail.
Customized as in -
1) You can change the command.
2) You can change the radius of protection.
3) I can change the message which is sent when a player tries to kill someone with lava.
4) And anything else which you want me to add.

Thank You!
